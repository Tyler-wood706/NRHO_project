# NRHO_project
Attempted to model a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit around the Moon using a restricted 3-body system set of equations. This was a final project for a Python-based Computational Physics class at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, in which I had to teach the class how to use a certain library (in this case, VPython), so most of the project is a slideshow on how to use the library. The restriced 3-body simulation is at the end of the slideshow. Excuse the crude controls and lack of easily-changeable initial conditions,
as it was only built for the presentation :)

- Keep 'NRHO.png' in the same file location as the project file.
- Main project file is a Jupyter Notebook, created and opened in a local Jupyter browser tab.
